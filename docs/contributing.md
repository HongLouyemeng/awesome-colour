## Adding to Awesome Colour

Please ensure your pull request adheres to the following guidelines:

- Make sure the suggestions are [awesome](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome/blob/master/awesome.md#only-awesome-is-awesome) before submitting.
- Search previous suggestions before making a new one, as yours may be a
  duplicate.
- Suggested applications and frameworks should be tested and documented.
- Make an individual pull request for each suggestion.
- Use the following format: `- [suggestion](link) - Description.`
- Additions should be inserted in alphabetical order into the relevant section.
- Keep descriptions short and simple, but descriptive.
- Start the description with a capital and end with a full stop/period.
- Don't start the description with `A` or `An`.
- Check your spelling and grammar.
- Make sure your text editor is set to remove trailing whitespace.
- The pull request should have a useful title and include a link to the
  suggestion and why it should be included.
- New sections or improvements to the existing sections are welcome, but
  should be done in a separate pull request.

Thank you for your suggestions!
